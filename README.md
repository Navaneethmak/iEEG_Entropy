process_entropy_NM.m 
Brainstorm process to compute Shannon Entropy values from the signal

steps to use it with brainstorm
1) add the file to "$HOME/.brainstorm/process/" folder
2) Once you open brainstorm you will find this code in the custom folder
3) Drag your signal into the brainstorm process tab and run the function from the custom code.
